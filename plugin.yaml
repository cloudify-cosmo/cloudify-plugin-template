    # URL to archive containing the plugin or name of directory containing
    # the plugin if it is included in the the blueprint directory under the
    # "plugins" directory.
    # Usage of "source" is supported, but not recommended, as it results in the
    # plugin going through `pip` installation on each and every agent (thus requiring
    # access to the `pip` repository/mirror, compilers and so forth).
    # Usage of plugin Wagon files, whenever possible, is recommended.
